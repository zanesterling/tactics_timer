# Tactics Timer

A super simple timer app to help me practice chess tactics problems. The app shows a timer onscreen that counts down from 2 minutes. When it reaches 0, the screen turns red. At any point the user can tap the screen to reset the timer to 2 minutes. A simple tool, but it's helped me be more systematic with my tactics training.

## Installation

First set up the flutter CLI and run `flutter doctor` to find and resolve any issues with your setup. Then plug in an iPhone or Android, set it to debugging mode, and `flutter run` to install and run the app on your phone.

Enjoy!
